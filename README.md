## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop

I had alot of fun with this one, maybe because I enjoyed playing the game or maybe because I was able to create some graphics art for it myself!  

## Optimizations

I added in some alerts when you reach certain amounts of dollars. Soon i'd like to implement a fun reward system after so many completed tasks that I'm actually able to gameify being productive!

## Lessons Learned:

Have fun with your projects and you'll go far with it, I know I did!
